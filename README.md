# Monte-Carlo-Pi-MPI
An MPI program in C to estimate the value of PI using the Monte Carlo method

Monte Carlo method computes the number of points in a set A that lies inside box R.  The ratio of the 
number of points that all inside A to the total number of points tried is equal to the ratio of the two areas. 
The accuracy of the ratio depends on the number of points used, with more points leading to a more 
accurate value.

This excersize was done for CS3700 Parallel Processing using the CPP HPC available to students and the MPI specification.
